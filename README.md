About: This repository will be use to push and pull any of the code that we as a group work on for our web application project for our client, KOACORE. KOACORE LLC is a health and safety management start-up founded by a Vanderbilt University graduate in 2020. Their primary business has been creating testing and vaccine verification programs for the music industry. Since the landscape surrounding COVID-19 is constantly evolving, KOACORE needs to expand their business into new markets. Our group has partnered with KOACORE to create a web app for their outbound processes. Potential clients will be able to input some basic information and see a live dashboard of KOACORE data that is relevant to them. KOACORE sales representatives will then be able to process that information and automatically email these clients and schedule meetings as needed. As a whole, our project will provide a unique solution to outbound sales while saving our client thousands of dollars on a CRM solution. We will be using some of the internal framework and databases from our client such as Airtable; however, most of our web UI design will be done using Javascript in conjuction with React. To deploy our web application, we plan to use use Elastic Beanstalk through Amazon Web Services.
